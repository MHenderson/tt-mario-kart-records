# tt-mario-kart-records

![Plot shows two line graphs, side-by-side. Both plots show percentage improvement in world records for Mario Kart 64 over time for multiple tracks. First plot is for world records without using a shortcut. Second plot is for world records using a shortcut. In both plots the same four tracks are highlighted, showing that, for those four tracks, improvements are dramatic (some way over forty percent) and seem to happen quickly, presumably as new shortcuts are discovered. World records without shortcuts, on the other hand, improve slowly and never reach as high as ten percent.](plot/mario-kart.png)
